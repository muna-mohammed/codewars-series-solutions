This code should store "codewa.rs" as a variable called name but it's not working. Can you figure out why?

# question:
a == "code"
b == "wa.rs"
name == a + b
    
# my own solution:
a = "code"
b = "wa.rs"
name = str(a + b)
 
 
# onther solution
a = "code"
b = "wa.rs"
name = a + b #replaced '==' with '='
